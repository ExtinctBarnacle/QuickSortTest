**TODO**
1. add timer to measure sort time
2. add filling of array of big length with random numbers
3. run sort many times with arrays of different lengthes and check run time dependency on array length
4. add other QuickSort implementations
5. translate Dual-pivot QuickSort algorithm from Java to C# (or look for automatic translator)
